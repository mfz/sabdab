Name    Description
PDB	The PDB accession code (e.g. 12e8)
Hchain	The chain identifier for the heavy chain (e.g. "H"). This is "NA" if the light chain is unpaired.
Lchain	The chain identifier for the light chain (e.g. "L"). This is "NA" if the heavy chain is unpaired.
model	The model identifier for the pairing (e.g "0","1","2"...). This is "0" for X-Ray structures )
antigen_chain	The chain identifier for the bound antigen chain (e.g. "A"). If the antigen has multiple bound antigen chains, these are separated by a "|" (e.g "X | Y"). For non-polymer antigens this refers to the chain identifier of the corresponding HETATM records (i.e. it may be the same as either the heavy or light chain identifier)
antigen_type	The classification of the antigen. Either: protein, peptide, carbohydrate, nucleic acid or hapten. This is "NA" if the heavy-light pairing is unbound.
antigen_het_name	The HETATM of the antigen if it is non-polymer. This is "NA" if the antigen is a polymer or the heavy-light pairing is unbound.
antigen_name	The name of the antigen. This is "NA" if heavy-light pairing is unbound or "?" if unknown.
short_header	The short header of the structure. Typically a short description of the type of molecule in the structure entry.
date	The deposition date of the structure to the PDB.
compound	The description of the molecule in structure. Typically the title of the associated publication.
organism	The organsim(s) of the molecule(s) in the structure.
heavy_species	The species of the heavy antibody chain. If it is from multiple species (e.g. Chimeric or Humanized) these will be separated by a single comma.
light_species	The species of the light antibody chain. If it is from multiple species (e.g. Chimeric or Humanized) these will be separated by a single comma.
antigen_species	The species of the antigen chain. If it is from multiple species these will be separated by a single comma.
authors	The authors of the structure.
resolution	The resolution of the structure if determined by X-Ray diffraction or Electron Microscopy.
method	The method with which the structure was determined.
r_free	The Rfree value of the structure if determined by X-Ray diffraction.
r_factor	The R factor value of the structure if determined by X-Ray diffraction.
scfv	Whether the structure is a single chain Fv. True or False. If true, the heavy and light chain identifiers may be the same depending on how the structure has been deposited.
engineered	Whether the structure has been engineered. True or False.
heavy_subclass	The IMGT variable subgroup of the heavy chain. Structures that are not available in the IMGT database have a subgroup assigned by SAbDab.
light_subclass	The IMGT variable subgroup of the light chain. Structures that are not available in the IMGT database have a subgroup assigned by SAbDab.
light_ctype	The type (Kappa or Lambda) of the light chain.
affinity	The affinity of the antibody to the antigen present in the structure (KD - M).
delta_g	The ΔG of the antibody to the antigen present in the structure (kcal/mol). This has been manually calculated.
affinity_method	The method by which the affinity data was collected (SPR, ITC or other).
temperature	The temperature at which the affinity data was collected (°C).
pmid	The pubmed identifier that is the source of the associated affintity data.
